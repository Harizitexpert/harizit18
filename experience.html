            <h2>Kohai Championship Season 3</h2>
            <p>Back in May 2023, my Mobile Legends Bang Bang(MLBB) Semi-professional team called Your Nemesis(YRN) made a personal new record by qualifying for the Kohai Championship Season 3 for the first time. After two seasons of being not qualified for the tournament, Alhamdulillah in 2023 we managed to qualify and even strive further to be the Top 16 team in the Championship. However, our journey ended up losing against a superior team in round-best 16. But, It was a happy day for me because the result of our hardship and harsh training session finally showed an impressive outcome that will forever kept as special memory in our life. Luckily, the Championship match was live recorded, and posted on YouTube by Kohai Official. I would like to share the video with you. We lose to a team called KAGE. </p>

            <h2>Medial Collateral Ligament Injury</h2>
        <div class="gallery">
            <img src="image/injuryss1.jpg" alt="MCL injury Image">
            </div>
            <p>This is one of the major injuries that I have experienced. It happened when I was 15 years of age. It happened in the middle of the MSSD 15s tournament and I was tackling a huge opponent so he fell on my right. As the impact and pressure from the guy who is twice my weight hit my leg, I felt tremendous pain in my knee. After that, I was diagnosed with MCL which is a sprain or tear to the ligament that connects your thigh bone to your shin bone on the inside of your knee. The recovery was long, I couldn't participate in all upcoming tournaments for about 5 months. The saddest thing was I couldn't join my team in a tournament that is well known in Boarding school which is SBP 10s. Basically, I started to active back on rugby a year after that and its effect remains. That's the reason I started to develop a new interest which is gaming.  </p>

            <h2>Internship at Hospital Parit Buntar</h2>
            <p>I have experience being an intern in a Hospital for IT Department. During my internship in the IT department of a hospital, I gained hands-on experience in troubleshooting hardware and software issues, managing network systems, and supporting the implementation of hospital management solutions. It was a fun experience in that I made new friends and also learned how society works. This experience allowed me to develop technical skills while adapting IT solutions to the unique challenges of a healthcare environment. It means a lot to me that they teach me tons of stuff  </p>
            <p>Duration: July 2024 - September 2024</p>
