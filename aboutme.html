        <div class="section">
            <center><h2>Background</h2>
            <p>I was born in Hospital Taiping and spent my early years growing up in the serene town of Bandar Baharu, Kedah. As the second of three siblings, my upbringing was filled with shared memories and valuable life lessons within a close-knit family. I currently reside in Taman Desa Mutiara, located in Parit Nibong, Kedah‚Äîa place that has become my home and a source of comfort.</p>
            <p>My educational journey led me to UiTM Kedah, where I built a solid foundation in my field of study. During my time there, I had the opportunity to participate in a variety of activities that enriched my academic experience and contributed significantly to my personal growth. It was also a time of discovery, as I gained knowledge and skills I never imagined learning before stepping into this institution. These experiences have shaped me into the person I am today and continue to inspire me to strive for excellence in all that I do.</p></center>

        <div class="section">
            <center><h2>Hobbies and Interests</h2>
            <p>In my free time, I enjoy immersing myself in various forms of entertainment that spark creativity and relaxation. Playing games on both mobile and PC is one of my favorite pastimes, as it allows me to connect with others in vibrant virtual worlds. I am also a passionate anime enthusiast, drawn to its captivating stories and visually stunning artistry. Alongside this, I love delving into manga and novels, where I can lose myself in imaginative narratives and explore different perspectives. These hobbies not only provide me with enjoyment but also inspire me with their creativity and depth.</p></center>
